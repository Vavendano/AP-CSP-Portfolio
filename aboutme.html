    <p>My name is Victor Avendano and I am taking the AP Computer Science class at Don Antonio Lugo High School. I have been here for four years and am going to graduate at the end of this year. I am also a part of the Don Lugo Hip Hop team. I hope that this class helps me build on my skills both in and out of school.</p>
