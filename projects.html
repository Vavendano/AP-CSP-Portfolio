  <p>The translator program we made doesn't server any functional purpose and was made purely for entertainment. Users have options of making their words into internet jokes or pig latin. For example, the blood function refers to the gang and essentially replaces c's and k's with b's. The uwu function replaces r's and l's with w's. The piglatin fucntion translates word into pig latin.</p>

  <p>The main issue we ran into was that Pig Latin would only take the first letter of a word and put in back with "ay" added. This was fine for most words but when it came to words like "shutter", the program would not give the accurate depiction of the word in Pig Latin. This was fixed by having the program check if there was a vowel as the third character. This would enable the first to characters in a word like "stutter" to move to the back and become accurately translated into Pig Latin. </p>
